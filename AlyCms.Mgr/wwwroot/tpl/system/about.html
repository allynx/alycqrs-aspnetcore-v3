        A front-end UI framework written by its own module specification follows the writing and organization form of native HTML / CSS / JS, with very low threshold, ready to use. It's simple on the outside, but full on the inside. It's light in volume and rich in components. Every detail from the core code to the API has been meticulously carved, which is very suitable for the rapid development of the interface.
